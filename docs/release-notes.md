# Lockbox Release Notes

## 0.1.1-alpha

_Date: 2017-10-30_

### What's New

When installing this extension, Firefox will no longer prompt to save logins.  Any logins saved in Firefox are still there, and you can still use it to autofill login forms, but the browser will not prompt to save new ones.  This feature will be re-enabled if you uninstall this extension, and will can be manually changed by the user in Firefox's preferences.

Note that this feature is only disabled on new installs of this extension; updating Lockbox will not change your current Firefox preferences.

### What's Fixed

Î©### Known Issues

* There is no way to change your Lockbox master password.  If you forget your master password, you'll need to start over fresh by either:
  - Opening the this extension's Settings page and clicking **\[INSERT ACTUAL NAME OF "FACTORY-RESET"]**; or
  - Uninstalling and re-installing the extension

## 0.1.0-alpha1

### What's New

This is a pre-release of the Lockbox password manager for internal Mozilla employees.

This starts as a signed Firefox extension where you can:

* Create a Lockbox account with a master password to lock/unlock your data
* View entries
* Search entries
* Add, edit, and delete entries
* Copy username and password to clipboard
* Submit feedback

### Known Issues

* Lockbox has only been tested on Firefox 57 and above.  Installing on Firefox 56 or lower may not function at all. 
* There is no way to reset your Lockbox master password. If you forget your master password, you'll need to start over fresh by uninstalling and re-installing this extension.
* This is a Lockbox account, which stays local to your Firefox installation. There is no integration with Firefox accounts to sync (yet).
